This is a Next.js app that will allows you to upload your Goodreads library and see cool charts about your reading history.

It is currently a WIP, but I will be regularly adding new charts and stats.

## Running locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Getting your Goodreads data

Log in to Goodreads, and go to [My Books > Import/Export](https://www.goodreads.com/review/import). Click `Export Library`. The file that downloads can be used in this app!
